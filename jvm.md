1. **Managing JVM versions**: Use Sdkman for effectively managing versions
```
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
sdk list java
sdk install java 17.0.10-amzn
sdk install java 17.0.9-graalce
sdk use java 17.0.9-graalce
sdk default java 17.0.10-amzn
```

2. **Microbenchmarking with JMH**: The Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) is a toolkit designed for benchmarking Java code. It helps in accurately measuring the performance of small units of code. Use JMH to identify performance bottlenecks and validate optimizations:
    ```java
    // Example benchmark code snippet
    @Benchmark
    public void measureName() {
        // benchmarked code here
    }
    ```

3. **Memory Analysis with MAT**: The Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT) is essential for diagnosing memory leaks and analyzing heap dumps. MAT can help you understand memory consumption and find potential leaks in Java applications.
